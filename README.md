Tune-Notifier
=============

## What is it?
Tune Notifier is an app for OS X 10.8 that notifies the user what song iTunes is currently playing, using the new Notifications feature in Mountain Lion.
Have you ever seen what [Last.fm](http://last.fm) Scrobbler does when integrated with [Growl](http://growl.info)? Tune Notifier does the same thing, but using the native notifications system built in OS X.

## Why open source it?
I believe that making Tune Notifier open source, developers will be able to enhance even better the app's performance, not forgeting to include me on the credits, of course!

## How does the app communicate with iTunes?
Take a look at [Scripting Bridge](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ScriptingBridgeConcepts/Introduction/Introduction.html) on Apple's documentation.
